# Hello World, welcome to my project! 

## What is going on here?
So, this is a fun automated way to spin up a Linux AWS Instance or really any infrastructure without using any outside products like Asible or something like Terraform. 

# How do I run? 
Running the program will be super easy!

## All you the user needs to do is the following things: 

1. Clone this repo and bring it down to your local machine amd navigate to the folder where ever you decide to do so. If you do not know how to clone a repo down to your machine here is a helpful video to do so and how to navigate to the folder. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcqniGu3tA

2. Verify that you have the most up-to-date version of Python installed on your machine
I used `Python 3.9.1` to build this project. If you need help downloading python 3 here is 
a link to the documentation to help you do that. -> https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. After cloning, navigating, and Python3 verification you will only need to run the following command in your terminal: `python3 main.py`( This will run the main script, surprise!) and follow the directions/prompts that the program supplies.
